# Podcast selector for Bailingguo podcast

為了更方便的重聽百靈果，所以寫了一個網站，以便於篩選想聽的集數。為了確保資訊安全，以及受限於架站所採用的技術（靜態網站），本網站不提供自動同步播放隊列到各播客服務，僅能通過新標籤頁面手動把集數添加到播放隊列。

In order to make it easier to listen to Bailingguo podcast, I wrote a website to facilitate the selection of the episodes I want to listen to. In order to ensure IT security and limited by the technology used by the website (static website), this website does not provide automatic synchronization of the playback queue to each podcast service. You can only manually add episodes to the playback queue through the new tab page.
